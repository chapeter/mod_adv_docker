## Why do we care

We'll be creating docker containers for many of our demos.  Though we don't need the level of exactness used in commercial distributions, we do want to make sure we build respectable containers, that follow standards and best practices.  Also, doing what we can to keep them small and quick to build/rebuild will help in our development practices.
